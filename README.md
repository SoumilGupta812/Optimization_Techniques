# Counter App

A **React practice project** built to understand **how React works internally** and how to **optimize component performance** using modern React techniques.

---

## 🚀 Covered Concepts
- Understanding React’s component tree and rendering behavior
- Analyzing component re-renders using React DevTools Profiler
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders with `memo`
- Optimizing components using `useCallback` and `useMemo`
- Understanding React’s Virtual DOM
- Using keys correctly while managing and resetting state
- State scheduling and batching in React
- Basic performance optimization concepts

---

## ⚙️ Run Locally 
```bash 
npm install 
npm run dev 
```

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Hooks (`useCallback`, `useMemo`)
- React DevTools

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How React renders and re-renders components
- Identifying performance bottlenecks using the Profiler
- Optimizing component execution with memoization
- Proper usage of keys to manage component state correctly
- Improving performance by structuring components effectively
